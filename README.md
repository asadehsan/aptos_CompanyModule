Secure Employee Access Tracker
Project Title
Aptos Employee Access Control and Time Tracking System
Project Description
This smart contract system, built on the Aptos blockchain, provides a secure and immutable solution for tracking employee access to different project facilities. The system maintains a decentralized ledger that records when employees enter and exit designated Offshore Development Centers (ODCs), ensuring accurate time tracking and proper authentication.
Key Features

Secure Authentication: Verifies employee identity and project access rights before granting entry
Immutable Time Records: Records check-in and check-out times on the blockchain, preventing tampering
Project-Specific Access Control: Allows administrators to define which employees can access specific project areas
Audit Trail: Generates blockchain events for all entries and exits, creating a permanent and transparent record

Technical Implementation
The solution is implemented as a Move smart contract on the Aptos blockchain with a clean, efficient design:

EmployeeRecord struct stores employee data including:

Employee ID
List of authorized projects
Time tracking information
Current presence status


Two primary functions handle all operations:

register_employee: Allows administrators to add new employees and set permissions
track_access: Records entry/exit times and verifies access authorization



Security Considerations

Only authorized company administrators can register new employees
Access control verifies employee permissions before allowing entry to project areas
All transactions are immutably recorded on the blockchain
Time tracking is based on secure blockchain timestamps

Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize employee time tracking and facility access control through blockchain technology. Traditional systems suffer from several drawbacks:

Centralized vulnerabilities: Susceptible to data manipulation and single points of failure
Limited transparency: Difficult for employees to verify their own recorded time
Complicated auditing: Time-consuming process to verify historical records
Manual reconciliation: Requires significant effort to integrate with payroll and project systems

By leveraging Aptos blockchain technology, our solution creates:

Trustless time recording: Neither employers nor employees need to trust a central authority
Immutable audit trail: Complete historical record that cannot be altered
Automated compliance: Transparent adherence to access policies
Foundation for smart compensation: Potential for automatic payroll based on verified blockchain records

Future Roadmap

Integration with digital identity solutions
Mobile application for easy check-in/out
Analytics dashboard for management insights
Automated payroll integration based on verified work hours
Multi-factor authentication options for heightened security
