# Aptos Employee Access Control and Time Tracking System

## Project Description

This smart contract system, built on the Aptos blockchain, provides a secure and immutable solution for tracking employee access to different project facilities. The system maintains a decentralized ledger that records when employees enter and exit designated Offshore Development Centers (ODCs), ensuring accurate time tracking and proper authentication.

### Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Verifies employee identity and project access rights before granting entry
- **Immutable Time Records**: Records check-in and check-out times on the blockchain, preventing tampering
- **Project-Specific Access Control**: Allows administrators to define which employees can access specific project areas
- **Audit Trail**: Generates blockchain events for all entries and exits, creating a permanent and transparent record

### Technical Implementation

The solution is implemented as a Move smart contract on the Aptos blockchain with a clean, efficient design:

```
EmployeeRecord {
    employee_id: String,
    authorized_projects: vector<String>,
    last_check_in: u64,
    last_check_out: u64,
    is_present: bool
}
```

Two primary functions handle all operations:
- `register_employee`: Allows administrators to add new employees and set permissions
- `track_access`: Records entry/exit times and verifies access authorization

### Security Considerations

- Only authorized company administrators can register new employees
- Access control verifies employee permissions before allowing entry to project areas
- All transactions are immutably recorded on the blockchain
- Time tracking is based on secure blockchain timestamps

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize employee time tracking and facility access control through blockchain technology. Traditional systems suffer from several drawbacks:

1. **Centralized vulnerabilities**: Susceptible to data manipulation and single points of failure
2. **Limited transparency**: Difficult for employees to verify their own recorded time
3. **Complicated auditing**: Time-consuming process to verify historical records
4. **Manual reconciliation**: Requires significant effort to integrate with payroll and project systems

By leveraging Aptos blockchain technology, our solution creates:

- **Trustless time recording**: Neither employers nor employees need to trust a central authority
- **Immutable audit trail**: Complete historical record that cannot be altered
- **Automated compliance**: Transparent adherence to access policies
- **Foundation for smart compensation**: Potential for automatic payroll based on verified blockchain records

### Future Roadmap

1. Integration with digital identity solutions
2. Mobile application for easy check-in/out
3. Analytics dashboard for management insights
4. Automated payroll integration based on verified work hours
5. Multi-factor authentication options for heightened security
